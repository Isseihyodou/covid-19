     <p>Doctors play an important role and most importantly they are important role during this period of time while treating and fighting with coronavirus patients.Most of the doctors havde losted their lives while to other patients. Doctors are trying their best to heal other patients  . As we that in Italy MANY doctors have losted their life. Many doctors are working day and night
     and so they are sleeping in the hospital and they arent able to meet their families. As they are sacrificing so much..so we should respect their sacrifice and stay at home, not going into a crowed place.etc taing care of our health.</p>
